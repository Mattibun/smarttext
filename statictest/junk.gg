return := This is an example {of a file filled with
/*note: save for later
3;10;11;20;25;110} years {old;young}!}
othervariable:=This is commented out, so it shouldn't show up at all. */
JUNK!! There's so much {} {{{}} {}} crap in here that really and 
{truly;{;super }surely} shouldn't show up at all.} It even has a ton of trailing {whitespace and /* note: rephrase this sentence? It's a bit garbage */ comments between
sentences. Well, hopefully my recursive sanitizer does a good job of it!}
